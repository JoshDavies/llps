# Theme Builder

A Font End App with multiple color themes. This project is a React App with SCSS and TypeScript. Although, this Project is intended as a small project, the folder structure is setup to be scalable for larger projects, including an icon library and bootstrap.  
  
Deployed to GitHub pages: [Visit live Webpage](https://joshdavies.github.io/theme-builder/)  *please note, this is currently a work in progress.*    
   
## Project Objectives:   
The main goal of this project is to learn more complex scss and use it to deliver a front end with multiple color themes.    
  
Maintainable - The color themes are encapsulated in their own files, with different levels of abstraction; a color can be replaced in the theme or a certain use case for that color can be swapped, all independently of other themes. This was an important criteria for me as light and dark modes are not simply mirror opposites.  
  
Dry - The code repeats itself as little as possible, making it easy to amend styling without having to go through every styling file. Whilst itâ€™s not a massive challenge for small projects it does create a legacy challenge as projects grow so itâ€™s best to implement a solution from the beginning.  
  
Scalable - There are currently 2 MVP themes (light & dark) but the project allows for additional themes to be added (at a later date) without having to restructure the existing code. This is useful when re-branding or having to support multiple brands.  
  
Dynamic - The App will match the users preferred OS color scheme. However, it is possible to overwrite this with a click of a button. Changing the color scheme saves the users preference to local storage. This also ensures that the color scheme persists after a page refresh.
